# My simple gallery

I have been doing road trips (and not only) since 2018, when I bought my first car. Since 2023, I started taking photos at the request of my mother.

For ease of display, I wrote a simple website.

The list of photos is also available in my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1AS5F6sgSSffWyrvnYlLq9EKoyQ9w_mIQ)
